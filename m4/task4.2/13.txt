It means:

    user linuxsir is owner and can read and write on test.txt
    group root can only read
    Anyone else can only read

It doesn't say that group rootis owner of the file, it is only saying which permissions group roothas over the file.

By default, the owner of a file is the user who created it and the group assigned to a file is the primary group of the user. However, you can change the group of a file using chgrp.
