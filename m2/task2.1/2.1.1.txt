VMware - The leader in the Tier-1 hypervisors is VMware with their vSphere/ESXi product â€“ available in a free 
edition and 5 commercial editions. VMware led the market in developing innovative features such as
 memory overcommitment, vMotion, Storage vMotion, Fault Tolerance, and more.

Hyper-V - Along with XenServer and vSphere (next on the list), Hyper-V is one of the top 3 Tier-1 
hypervisors (frequently flip/flopping between 2nd and 3rd place with XenServer). 
First released with Windows Server, Hyper-V has now been greatly enhanced with Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V.

Xen - Xen is a type-1 bare-metal hypervisor. Just as Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses KVM, Citrix uses 
Xen in the commercial XenServer. In 2007 Citrix bought XenSource, Inc, who supported Xen. Today, the Xen open 
source projects and community are at Xen.org. 

RedHat - Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) is a commercial implementation of the KVM Type-1 hypervisor. 
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses SPICE protocol and VDSM (Virtual Desktop Server Manager) with a 
RHEL-based centralized management server.
